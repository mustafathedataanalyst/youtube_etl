# YouTube ETL Pipeline | Data Engineering Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from YouTube using Python, runs the script using Airflow on Amazon EC2, and loads the data into AWS S3.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to extract data from a YouTube channel, process it, and store it in AWS S3. This pipeline automates the extraction of channel statistics and video details, and schedules the process using Airflow on an EC2 instance.
